IRlamp

A quick project to light an LED bank with brightness dynamically adjusted depending on surrounding lightning conditions.

The LED bank can be turned on and off with a remote control. I used the remote control I had on hand which is the one from a Kaiboer HD1055 media player.

The IR library used is from https://github.com/shirriff/Arduino-IRremote

This is also my first attempt at hosting a project on github to figure how this whole thing works.
